How do I approach designing software?

    New Design Skills: This project helped me craft skills in 3D design and spatial thinking. I learned to visualize how objects interact within a 3D space and how lighting and textures affect the overall aesthetic and perception of a scene.
    Design Process: My design process involved conceptualizing the scene, selecting objects that offer varied complexities, and planning their interactions and positioning. I emphasized lighting and texture to create a realistic and visually appealing environment.
    Application in Future Work: The tactics I've developed, like iterative design and focusing on user interaction, can be applied to future projects, especially those involving complex graphical interfaces or user-experience-driven design.

How do I approach developing programs?

    Development Strategies: For the 3D scene, I embraced a modular development strategy, creating custom functions for repetitive tasks like generating geometrical shapes and processing user inputs. This approach increased code readability and reuse.
    Iteration in Development: Iteration was a key factor. I frequently tested different configurations of lighting, textures, and camera controls to achieve the desired visual effects and user experience.
    Evolution of Development Approach: Throughout the project, my code development evolved from focusing on basic functionality to refining the user interaction and visual appeal of the scene. I progressively integrated more complex shaders and refined the camera control system for a smoother user experience.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

    Educational Pathway: Computational graphics and visualization have equipped me with a unique set of skills in spatial reasoning, algorithmic thinking, and creative problem-solving. These skills are invaluable in various fields of computer science and can be particularly beneficial in areas like virtual reality, game development, and UI/UX design.
    Professional Pathway: In a professional context, these skills open doors to careers in software development, especially in industries where 3D modeling and visualization are crucial. This includes fields like game development, architectural visualization, and interactive media. The ability to create engaging and intuitive 3D environments is a highly sought-after skill in these areas.
